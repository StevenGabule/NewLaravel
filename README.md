# Learning the new Laravel version 9 and the NextJS

Laravel is for API using Breeze for scalfolding the authentication system
For the frontend I'm going to used the NextJS framework for building the User interface.
For database I'm going to use PostgresQL which more prefer right now for buidling enterprise project.
There will be using third party api like Algolia or MeiliSearch for flexible searching.

I will use redux toolkit for caching system in the frontend and redis on backend.
There will be realtime calculation and update on the complicated pages so for that we're going to use the laravel packages that already build and support.
